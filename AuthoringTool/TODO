Display:
	Add the capability to run the course 3 times - Tracking

Later:
	Authoring Tool:
		Code:
			-CheckBox vs SimpleCheckBox: SimpleCheckBox does not
			have valueChangeHandler althouch ClickHandler works ok. CheckBox
			does not have static .wrap method

			use private variables to store containers and DOM stuff

			have a common way to represent
				-document loading
				-document changes via widgets
				-document changes via program logic (undo / redo)
					The way to do this is the following
					Implement Lesson listener that spawns events
					on document change. All widget should listen
					for document changes and update their selves

			up down via drag & drop. Note that buttons don't seem to be
			able to listen to drag events

	Moodle:
		show documents inline (may require a plugin)
		Use moodle file facilities for storing and retrieving files

Immediate:
	HTML:
		scrollbars are counted in the box model. Find the fix

	PHP:
		cruize mode
		on save delete non used resources
		On duplication I get Fatal error: Class 'backup_orthoeman_activity_task' not found in /usr/share/moodle/backup/util/factories/backup_factory.class.php on line 107

	Layout:

		Moodle: group and button. Needs to make everything else invisible
		AuthoringTool:
			get rid of menu bar. We only need save, debug, bug report
			use left and right panel

	Discussion:
		Tracking - Display tool should be able to inform moodle about the progress / grades of the
			student, submit.php get_submission.php
