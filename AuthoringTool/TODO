Display:
	scale resize images otherwise brightness contrast controls are out of screen

	brightness contrast loose the orignal image

	on reload user spots should be visible

	correct entries should be green not red

Authoring Tool:
	Image Editor
		handle brightness / contrast
		eraser

	Range Question Editor
	write xml
	read xml

	HTML:
		Make buttons in pageButton have aspect 4/3 with padding
			-add selection color if you can

	Code:
		-CheckBox vs SimpleCheckBox: SimpleCheckBox does not
		have valueChangeHandler althouch ClickHandler works ok. CheckBox
		does not have static .wrap method

		use private variables to store containers and DOM stuff

		have a common way to represent
			-document loading
			-document changes via widgets
			-document changes via program logic (undo / redo)
				The way to do this is the following
				Implement Lesson listener that spawns events
				on document change. All widget should listen
				for document changes and update their selves

	Build:
		fix gwt compilation. With this we could automate the deploy

	Later:
		up down via drag & drop. Note that buttons don't seem to be
		able to listen to drag events

	Immediate:
		Disable image editing buttons
			if there is no image
			if a drawing operation is in proceess

		move hotspots to ImageItem
		clear hotspots on Image reset

		add hotspots so they are redrawn


Moodle Integration:
	Authentication - Authorization (moodle should provide us with some id)
	Use data backend for storing resources (xml & images & videos)
	Authoring Tool should be able to launch the Display Tool
