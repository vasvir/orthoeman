Authoring Tool:
	Code:
		-CheckBox vs SimpleCheckBox: SimpleCheckBox does not
		have valueChangeHandler althouch ClickHandler works ok. CheckBox
		does not have static .wrap method

		use private variables to store containers and DOM stuff

		have a common way to represent
			-document loading
			-document changes via widgets
			-document changes via program logic (undo / redo)
				The way to do this is the following
				Implement Lesson listener that spawns events
				on document change. All widget should listen
				for document changes and update their selves

	Build:
		fix gwt compilation. With this we could automate the deploy

	Later:

		able to listen to drag events

	Immediate for TC meeting:
