Display:
	scale resize images otherwise brightness contrast controls are out of screen

	brightness contrast loose the orignal image

	on reload user spots should be visible

	correct entries should be green not red

Authoring Tool:
	write xml
	read xml

	Code:
		-CheckBox vs SimpleCheckBox: SimpleCheckBox does not
		have valueChangeHandler althouch ClickHandler works ok. CheckBox
		does not have static .wrap method

		use private variables to store containers and DOM stuff

		have a common way to represent
			-document loading
			-document changes via widgets
			-document changes via program logic (undo / redo)
				The way to do this is the following
				Implement Lesson listener that spawns events
				on document change. All widget should listen
				for document changes and update their selves

	Build:
		fix gwt compilation. With this we could automate the deploy

	Later:
		up down via drag & drop. Note that buttons don't seem to be
		able to listen to drag events

	Mouse move should print angles as overlays

	Immediate for TC meeting:
		Image Editor
			eraser
			handle brightness / contrast
		Range Question Editor
		HTML:
			Make buttons in pageButton have aspect 4/3 with padding
				-add selection color if you can
		Power point presentation


Moodle Integration:
	Authentication - Authorization (moodle should provide us with some id)
	Use data backend for storing resources (xml & images & videos)
	Authoring Tool should be able to launch the Display Tool
