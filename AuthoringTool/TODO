Later:
	Authoring Tool:
		Code:
			-CheckBox vs SimpleCheckBox: SimpleCheckBox does not
			have valueChangeHandler althouch ClickHandler works ok. CheckBox
			does not have static .wrap method

			use private variables to store containers and DOM stuff

			have a common way to represent
				-document loading
				-document changes via widgets
				-document changes via program logic (undo / redo)
					The way to do this is the following
					Implement Lesson listener that spawns events
					on document change. All widget should listen
					for document changes and update their selves

			up down via drag & drop. Note that buttons don't seem to be
			able to listen to drag events


		Layout
			IE9: quizContainer textarea cannot be made to push the two other rows (answer's scrollbarContainer, addAnAnswer row)

	Moodle:
		show documents inline (may require a plugin)
		Use moodle file facilities for storing and retrieving files

Later:
	fix API to have _from_orthoeman_id and consolidate the use of get_moodle_data()
	move sslayer.php to moodle directory
	move Display and AuthoringTool under moodle
	make the project GPL and post it to github

Immediate:
	BUGS:
