Display:
	on reload user spots should be visible

Authoring Tool:
	write xml
	read xml

	Code:
		-CheckBox vs SimpleCheckBox: SimpleCheckBox does not
		have valueChangeHandler althouch ClickHandler works ok. CheckBox
		does not have static .wrap method

		use private variables to store containers and DOM stuff

		have a common way to represent
			-document loading
			-document changes via widgets
			-document changes via program logic (undo / redo)
				The way to do this is the following
				Implement Lesson listener that spawns events
				on document change. All widget should listen
				for document changes and update their selves

	Build:
		fix gwt compilation. With this we could automate the deploy

	Later:
		up down via drag & drop. Note that buttons don't seem to be
		able to listen to drag events

	Immediate for TC meeting:
		Power point presentation

	Missing:
		drawing areas that are not hotspots (extra toggle drawing button required)
			different colors for hotspots, info areas
		calculate and display angles between lines in mouse move
		crosshair pointer

	HTML:
		IE:
			eraser svg icon
			scrollbars are counted in the box model. Find the fix

Moodle Integration:
	Authentication - Authorization (moodle should provide us with some id)
	Use data backend for storing resources (xml & images & videos)
	Authoring Tool should be able to launch the Display Tool
