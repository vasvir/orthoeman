[]{#anchor}[]{#anchor-1}Introduction
------------------------------------

[]{#anchor-2}Software Requirements
----------------------------------

The OrthoEMan plugin and its modules have been developed with the newest
W3C standards in mind in order to provide a modern experience to all
faculty members including both the teacher and the students. Thus any
HTML5 compatible browser should be enough for working with the OrthoEMan
plugin. Furthermore the plugin has been explicitly tested with

-   Firefox 19
-   Chrome 23
-   Internet Explorer 10

It is strongly advised to keep the computer which will access to the
OrthoEMan facility in good shape with the latest updates applied.

[]{#anchor-3}Entering Moodle
----------------------------

The e-learning platform (Moodle) will be finally hosted at
[www.orthoe-eman.ro](http://www.orthoe-eman.ro/).

You can access the OrthoEMan\'s project development moodle site you have
to startup your browser and visit the above URL. It should look like the
picture below.

![](.//Pictures/10000000000004220000036A5D2F43A7.png){width="16.256cm"
height="13.427cm"}

Click on "E-learning center" to access the e-learning platform/center.

You will see the next window:

![](.//Pictures/100000000000033A000001280C2288ED.png){width="16.159cm"
height="5.779cm"}

On this page you have to select which type of course you want: for
medical staff or for engineers.

If you select the course for medical staff you will see the next
window:![](.//Pictures/10000000000004D0000001C1DF2932F9.png){width="17.189cm"
height="6.272cm"}

Now you can select your desired module. For example, for Module 1 (as
medical staff) you will see the next window (a similar one for
engineers):

![](.//Pictures/1000000000000712000002382B031B2E.png){width="17.177cm"
height="5.389cm"}

If you choose a sub-module you have to login to the e-learning platform.
Note that if you are not already registered with the system you will be
given (in the right side) the opportunity to register. In the
registration form you need to fill your name, surname and e-mail
address. There are more elements of information that you can add at a
later stage like detailed contact info in social networks and such.

The system will sent you an e-mail at the address you gave and you have
to follow the instructions in order to complete your registration.

![](.//Pictures/100000000000065E000001ECA2A3E12A.png){width="17cm"
height="5.131cm"}

To gain access to the resources and tools you have first to log in. Type
your user name and password in the corresponding fields and press Enter.

If you don't remember your password, click on the link "[**Forgotten
your username or
password?**](http://orthoeman.iit.demokritos.gr/moodle/login/forgot_password.php)"
which redirects you to the next page.

To reset your password, submit your username or your email address
below. If we can find you in the database, an email will be sent to your
email address, with instructions how to get access again.

![](.//Pictures/100000000000065F0000016C9EE6254C.png){width="17.175cm"
height="3.833cm"}

After a successful login the page redirects you to the "My Courses"
page. To enter the course just click on its name. However if this is
your first time in moodle it is possible that "My Courses" is empty.
After your registration and login you can proceed to enroll your self to
the various offered courses.

The self enrollment procedure is very simple but you will need on
enrollment key per course. The enrollment keys are one time passwords in
order to confirm that you have the credentials to take that course. The
enrollment keys must be distributed by your teacher either in person or
via electronic means.

Click on the course you wish to enroll yourself. The following picture
will appear (if you haven\'t already enrolled yourself).

![](.//Pictures/1000000000000577000000FBF1E6CC55.png){width="17cm"
height="3.048cm"}

After a successful self enrollment you can enter the course

In this example where you choose sub-module 1-3, the schedule of it is
one week from March and you can see for this sub-module the lecture
notes (a brief presentation of this sub-module), this specific course
(as pdf file) and a small quiz for self-testing (after you have learned
this subject).

In this example you can see a weekly outline with one OrthoEMan
activity. The outline of the course, meaning the way the time slots are
allocated, is entirely decision of the course creator. The course
creator depending on the administrator may be different than the course
author (editing teacher).

[]{#anchor-4}Display Tool
-------------------------

The **Display Tool** is the main interface point with the student. The
student evokes the Display Tool by just selecting the appropriate
lesson.

### []{#anchor-5}First Contact

The title and the case\'s description that are displayed in the initial
screen of the **Display Tool** have been entered in case configuration
page as it is illustrated at Illustration .

![Illustration 1: Display Tool: First
Contact](.//Pictures/10000000000004EB000003E157FD9C5C.png){width="17cm"
height="13.407cm"}

The student can navigate between pages by using the buttons on the upper
part of the screen. The clock that shows the remaining time for the
lesson completion is displayed in the lower-right part of the screen. It
has two mode: the compact mode which it is the default and the expanded
mode which it is evoked by clicking the compact clock. Illustration (a)
and (b) shows these two clock versions.

### []{#anchor-6}Pages Type

A lesson consists of a collection of pages as section [Error: Reference
source not found](#anchor-7) describes. Each page may contain theory or
questions towards the students. The pages that are compose of questions
expect feedback from the student. Depending of the page type the answers
are ranging from selecting the correct hotspots in an image to picking
up the correct phrases(quiz). Then, the Display Tool informs the student
if his answer is correct or wrong (Illustration (a) and (b)). The
Display Tool may provide the correct answer if the student answer it
wrong but only by the teacher consent.

#### []{#anchor-8}***Image**** -- ****Text***

The **Image -- Text** page type is used to present theory pages which
they contain just an image and text. Moreover, it may used for hotspot
identification by the students.

![Illustration 4: Image
Tools](.//Pictures/10000000000001CD0000002834D5E9A2.png){width="12.197cm"
height="1.058cm"}

When a page contains an image, the student has in his disposal a number
of tools in order to manipulate the image to help him answer the
question. Illustration depicts those tools. From left to right:

-   **1-1**: Removes zooming scaling. Resets images dimensions to the
    original values.
-   **Zoom In**:. Zooms in by 20%.
-   **Zoom Out**: Zooms out by 20%.
-   **Invert:** Invert the image colors.
-   **Brightness**: Change the image brightness.
-   **Contrast**: Change the image contrast.
-   **Hotspot** **Selector**: By pressing this button, the student will
    be able to create points in the image suitable for the hotspot
    identification questions.
-   **Crosshair Tool**: Draws a crosshair tool across the image.
-   **Line**: Draws a line. Lines are helper elements for the students
    and they are painted with a yellow pen. If multiple lines are drawn
    and the mouse hovers over an intersection the automatic angle
    calculation tool kicks in and displays the angle in degrees
    (Illustration ).
-   **Reset**: Resets the image to original state. Removes the
    Brightness/Contrast and Invert effects.

The Illustration shows the **image -- text** page type when involves
hotspot identification. The student by pressing the **Hotspot Drawing
Tool** must point in the image the correct area. The number of required
hotspots are defined from the question. The hotspot can be deleted by
hovering the mouse cursor over it and pressing the left button. When the
required hotspots are created by the student, the "Submit your Answer"
button appears and the answer is ready to be send.

#### []{#anchor-9}***Image*** -- Quiz

The image (Illustration ) shows how **Display Tool** illustrates the
**Image -- Quiz** page type. The student can select one or more choices
from the available answers. When at least one answer is selected, a
button labeled "Submit your Answer" will appear. The student by pressing
this button, he submit his answer.

height="13.323cm"}

#### []{#anchor-10}***Image*** -- Range Quiz

The I**mage -- Range Quiz** page type requires the student to submit a
value by studying the associate image and deduce from it the correct
answer. He has in his disposal all the image tools that are described
earlier (including the cross-line mode) to figure out the answer. When
he enters a value the "Submit your Answer" button appears so that he may
submit it.

#### []{#anchor-11}***Video*** -- Text

The **Video -- Text** page type is used only for theory and not for
student\'s evaluation. It is not requires any action from the student.
The authoring teacher provides a video and a text that highlights the
more relevant points of it.

height="13.058cm"}

#### []{#anchor-12}***Video*** -- Quiz

The **Video -- Quiz** page type is like the Image -- Quiz, where instead
of an image there is a video. The student can watch the accompany video
and then, he must select one or more choices from the available answers.
When at least one answer is selected, a button labeled "Submit your
Answer" will appear. The student by pressing this button, he submit his
answer.

#### []{#anchor-13}***Text*** -- Quiz
