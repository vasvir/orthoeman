BUG: if the orthoeman module is hidden and the user resizes its window - it does not getting notified.
Steps to reproduce
	-Go to the case that it includes an orthoeman case
	-Show the Authoring Tool (Note that correctly expands to the whole screen)
	-Hide the Authoring Tool
	-Resize the window slightly
	-Show the Authoring Tool (Note that is not correctly filling up the available vertical space)
Looks like there is code to handle the resize after the wake up (show). It
just gets the vertical height wrong.
See below:
